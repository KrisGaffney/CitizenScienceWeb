This lightweight plugin will made your menu or header sticky on top of page, after desired number of pixels when scrolled.

== Description ==
By default, sticky menu is designed to use element class ".navbar" as "Sticky Class". That value should be modified in plugin settings for different themes to make it work. Sticky Class is actually nothing more than an element class (or id) of the element that should become sticky. 

Advancement of this simple plugin is that increases usability and page views of your WordPress site since menu is available to the user all the time.

Plugin is localized (multi language support) and responsive (as far as your theme is). Also there is possibility to add custom css code which make this plugin very flexible, customizable and user friendly.

Plugin is originally designed for Twenty Thirteen template but should work on any theme.

== Installation ==
Install like any other plugin. After install activate. 
Go to Settings / myStickymenu and change Sticky Class to .your_navbar_class or #your_navbar_id . Sticky Class should be HTML id or class of the HTML element desired to be sticky… Clear WordPress cache if exists.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to find Sticky Class, what should I enter here? =
So this depends on what you want to make sticky and what theme do you use, but for example if you want your menu to be sticky, than you can examine the code (in firefox right click and “View page source”) and find HTML element in which your menu is situated. This element have some class or id, and that’s the Sticky Class we need. If using class than don’t forget to ad dot (.) in front of class name, or hash (#) in front of id. Twenty Thirteen default working class is ".navbar" without of quotes.

= Is there any way to restrict the width to the width of the header, rather than it being full width? =
Yes, just leave "Sticky Background Color" field blank (clear). Than if needed define custom background color for sticky header inside ".myfixed css class" field using .myfixed class. 

= Ho do I add small logo to the menu? =
That will depend on a theme you use, but if initially your menu and logo are in one div than you can use that div class or id in myStickymenu settings. 

If not you can change that in your header template file and add logo and menu divs inside new div with some custom class or id, than use that class or id in myStickymenu settings as a sticky class.

In CSS you can style your custom class while not sticky using custom class you added before. Furthermore you can style your menu while sticky using .myfixed class which is added by js to your custom class while sticky is active. 

In some cases you can use the whole header div and than just style it different with .myfixed class, hide what you don’t need using CSS display:none; property, and position logo and menu as you like.
