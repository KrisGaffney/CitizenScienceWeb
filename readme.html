This is a website created for Citizen Science Ireland.
It is live @ citizen-science.ie

Designed using WordPress the aim of this site is to promote Citizen Science Ireland and what it does.

Citizen Science Ireland is an initiative to harness the knowledge gained by practitioners and researchers and involve citizens across the different STEM disciplines in Ireland.

Citizen Science Ireland is member of the European Citizens Science Association and the aim is to build collaboration, community and credibility in the field of citizen science.

It shows the activities that the Insight Centre promotes within its organisation to get citizens involved in Science and also shows major projects that the Insight centre are involved in which relate to citizen science.
On the projects page there is live data being shown from a mobile weather station that is being used in communities and schools that aims to make people more aware of their environment and help to teach citizens and students about the environment they live in. 


About this Project

The main aim of this project is to promote Citizen Science and what it is trying to achieve.  This project is designed to be an informative website which tells users about Citizen Science, how it is trying to get citizens involved in activities based around science that are happening in their locality, and it will also display certain projects that are ongoing and will show live data that is being sent to this website based on these projects.
There is also a page which shows the people involved in the Citizen Science in Ireland.
Finally, the last page is a contact page which gives the user details on how to get in contact with the Chairman of Citizen Science Ireland.

Technical Specifications

This website is designed using WordPress and the site is live at the URL: http://citizen-science.ie/ .
In order to edit or update this website you will need to access the WordPress backend at the URL: http://citizen-science.ie/wp-admin/ and enter your login details. The people who have credentials to edit this website as Administrators are Brendan Smith, Martin Serrano, Niall oâ€™ Brolchain and Kristopher Gaffney. 
The website is designed using the OceanWP theme which is used in conjunction with the Ocean Extra plugin which gives you extra features for designing the layout of the website.
Two other plugins are being used for easy styling of this website. One of these is the Classic Editor plugin and the other one is the Elementor plugin. In using these two plugins it aids the designer in creating a more free-flowing website which users of all ages will find more appealing and easier to navigate.
The Duplicator plugin is used to copy the site and migrate it to the server.
The final plugin that is being used is the Weather Station plugin. This plugin is used to display live data that is being collected from a weather station in the Insight building. It does this by connecting to the Netatamo weather station via an API key.  Once connected you have many options of what you would like to display on the webpage. As long as the weather station stays connected to the network this data will be updated in real time. The Netatamo weather station is registered to Dr Martin Serrano so in order to gain access you will need to get in contact with him.  

Future Updates

At the moment this Citizen Science website is localised to Insight Centre in Galway.  This means that it is only showing Activities and projects that are based in and around the Galway area. The next step would be to roll out to the other Insight centres in Ireland and include their Activities and projects on the site.  Once all the Insights are involved and the site is working well, then outside Activities and projects that are not associated with Insight could be incorporated under the citizenscience.ie umbrella.
At the moment the only project that is displaying any data is the mobile unit.  As the website develops more projects will have to display data on the site in order to improve the interactivity of the site for the citizens.
