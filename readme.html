This is a website created for Citizen Science Ireland.
It is live @ citizen-science.ie

Designed using WordPress the aim of this site is to promote Citizen Science Ireland and what it does.

Citizen Science Ireland is an initiative to harness the knowledge gained by practitioners and researchers and involve citizens across the different STEM disciplines in Ireland.

Citizen Science Ireland is member of the European Citizens Science Association and the aim is to build collaboration, community and credibility in the field of citizen science.

It shows the activities that the Insight Centre promotes within its organisation to get citizens involved in Science and also shows major projects that the Insight centre are involved in which relate to citizen science.
On the projects page there is live data being shown from a mobile weather station that is being used in communities and schools that aims to make people more aware of their environment and help to teach citizens and students about the environment they live in.
